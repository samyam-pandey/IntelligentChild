Creating a good pull request:

  Before creating a pull request into the main branch, you should first complete a couple of steps.
  1. Pull main branch into your development branch. This makes sure that merge conflicts are never handled on the main branch and are instead handled within the development branch.
  2. Add a detailed description of the features when creating your request. This makes it easier for reviewers to locate changes to inspect before completing the request.
  3. Be open to your request being denied. A denied pull request means that the reviewer is performing their due dilligence. Be receptive to any comments as to why the request was denied.
